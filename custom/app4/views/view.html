  <h2>That's more like it!</h2>

  <p>A little bit of extra code inside your view's route:</p>

<pre>
res.locals.breadcrumbs = {
  links: [
    {url: '/', text: res.locals.string.home},
    {active: true, text: 'Breadcrumbs'}
  ]
}
</pre>

  <p><code>res.locals.breadcrumb</code> is a variable that holds the data about admin's breadcrumbs.<br />
  This variable is part of the admin's UI so it's rendered outside of your custom template.</p>
