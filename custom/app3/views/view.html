  <h4>I'm styled through custom local stylesheet</h4>

  <p>This custom view has its own custom <code>css</code> and <code>js</code> files but this time instead of adding them inside the <code>custom.json</code> file we're adding them inside the template itself.</p>
  <p>This makes them visible only for this view, you can inspect the document and see that they're not included inside the <code>head</code> tag of the document.</p>
  <p>Remember that you still have to define the absolute path to your public directory inside the <code>custom.json</code> file.</p>

  <div class="well">
    <p>Each of your custom files should have unique name among all included files even if they are in different directories!</p>
    <p>Express and Nginx serve the static files on first matched basis.</p>
  </div>
